**Bitmask** is the client for the services offered by `the LEAP Platform`_. It
contains a command-line interface and a multiplatform desktop client. It can be
also used as a set of libraries to communicate with the different services from
third party applications.

It is written in python using `Twisted`_  and licensed under the `GPL3`_. The
Graphical User Interface is written in html+js and uses `PyQt5`_ for serving the
application.

Package under development!
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a unified repo that has merged the following packages, previously isolated, under the leap namespace:

bonafide, mail, keymanager, bitmask.

The previous Qt client has been deprecated (bitmask version 0.8.2, still
available at the http://github.com/leapcode/bitmask_client repo).

Note that this repo still doesn't have support for VPN: its porting will
follow soon.

Development
===========================================================

Running Tests
-----------------------------------------------------------

You need tox to run the tests. If you don't have it in your system yet::

  pip install tox

And then run all the tests::

  tox


Hacking
-----------------------------------------------------------

In order to run bitmask in a development environment, you must activate a
virtualenv and install the various packages using 'pip install -e'. This
installs python packages as links to the source code, so that your code
changes are immediately reflected in the packages installed in the
virtualenv.

The ``make dev-*`` commands will run the appropriate ``pip install``
commands for you.

Install headless backend in development mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Prerequisites::

  sudo apt install build-essential python-virtualenv libsqlcipher-dev \
        libssl-dev libffi-dev

Install and activate a virtualenv::

  cd bitmask-dev
  virtualenv venv
  source venv/bin/activate

All the subsequent commands assume that you have activated the virtualenv.

Install all the python dependencies::

  make dev-backend

Install user interface frontend
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to run the Bitmask user interface, you additionally need the following:

Prerequisites::

  sudo apt install python-pyqt5  python-pyqt5.qtwebkit

Install python dependencies::

  make dev-all

Note: even though the UI is in javascript, Qt is used to create a webview window.  


Install Bitmask user interface in development mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The above instructions will install a python package that contains a pre-
bundled version of the javascript UI.

If you want to modify the javascript UI, then you need to be able to update the
javascript bundle whenever a javascript or CSS source file changes.

Prerequisites::

  sudo apt install nodejs npm nodejs-legacy

Next, run ``dev-install``::

  cd ui
  make dev-install    # install JS user interface as a python package in "develop" mode.
  node run watch      # continually rebuild javascript bundle when source files change.

For more information, see ``ui/README.md``.
