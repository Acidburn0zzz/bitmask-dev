This is the original implementation of the bitmask.js library, which uses the
REST api exposed by the HTTPRequestDispatcher.

The development of bitmask_js is in the www/ folder in this bitmask-dev repo.

A pre-compiled version of the html+js web-ui can be found in the leap.bitmask_www package.

This remains here to be able to develop against the REST api without the need
of installing the full-fledged bitmask_www package.
