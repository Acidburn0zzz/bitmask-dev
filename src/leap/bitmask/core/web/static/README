This is a simple html based console that uses the bitmask.js library, which
uses the REST api exposed by the HTTPRequestDispatcher. This html should be
served when leap.bitmask_js package is not found on the import path from where
bitmask.core is executed. 

The development of bitmask_js is in the ui/ folder in this bitmask-dev repo.

A pre-compiled version of the whole html+js ui can be found in the
leap.bitmask_js package. To have it served from the same endpoint than the REST
api, just install leap.bitmask_js in your environment.

This 'web console' remains here to be able to develop against the REST api
without the need of installing the full-fledged bitmask_js package. However,
it's only going to work when running from the git repository.
